## Project Abstract
  This project aims to implement a relational database management system. The DBMS consists of tables with row(s) and column(s), and query language to retrieve relevant information from the database. The project reflects our understanding on the low level working meachanism of database management system. Our implementation includes creation, deletion, updating of tables (more specifically, insertion of rows and etc.), and selection of desired information by stating conditions. Other than that, the DBMS will evaluate the sql commands and return relevant messages if errors occur for the purpose of reminding. For the ease of implementation, the "join" statement can be view as natural join by default. The implementation will also include retrieval of information from multiple tables. To test whether the implemented DBMS works properly and correctly or not, test cases will be provided for the enhancement of our DBMS and better user understanding. Additionnally, this project will extend some additional methods in order to re-implement Assignment2 such as in, order, etc.
