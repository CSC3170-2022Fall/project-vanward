# Project Specification
1. Implement the Row class, except for the Row(List<Column> columns, Row... rows)
constructor, which you should save for later. Make sure to write tests for the Row class.
2. Implement the parts of the Table class needed to create a new Table, add a Row to it,
and print an entire Table.
3. Implement the Database class.
4. Implement insert and load.
5. Implement the kind of select that takes a single table and has no conditions.
6. Implement the Row(List<Column> columns, Row... rows) constructor.
7. Now get single-table select with conditions to work.
8. Finally, work on the two-table variety of select.
Notice Every group member does their work on their own branch at the first stage.
